<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Formalization of programming language metatheory is an increasingly
active research field. Most languages have a notion of variable
binding which presents some of the main technical difficulties in
mechanical reasoning about languages. Traditional concrete
representations with named variables have the issues of
alpha-equivalence and alpha-conversion. An alternative
representation uses de Bruijn indices, eliminating the issue of
alpha-equivalence but introducing the need for lifting of indices.
The locally nameless representation offers a hybrid approach with names
for free variables and the de Bruijn indices for bound variables.
We study these three representations with untyped lambda-calculus
in the Coq proof assistant as a running example. We also briefly
consider two real-world cases of mechanized reasoning about languages
with variable binding.
